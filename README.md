## Why useWordPress

`useWordPress` is a collection of React Hooks designed specifically for WordPress Themes and Plugins developers. These hooks leverage the functionalities provided by the `@wordpress/elements` package, thereby utilizing WordPress React and avoiding the need to add another copy of React as a dependency.

## Installation

To install `useWordPress`, simply use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install usewordpress
```

or

```bash
yarn add usewordpress
```

## Usage

```jsx
import { useConfirm } from "@thewebforge/usewordpress";
import { check, trash } from "@wordpress/icons";
import { Button } from "@wordpress/components";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [confirmDelete, setConfirmDelete] = useConfirm();

  return (
    <Button
          variant="link"
          icon={confirmDelete ? check : trash}
          isDestructive={!confirmDelete}
          onClick={() => {
            if (!confirmDelete) {
              setConfirmDelete(true);
              return;
            }
            // Handle Deletion
          }}
        >
          Delete
        </Button>
  );
